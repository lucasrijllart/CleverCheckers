<h2>Draughts or Checkers</h2>

<h3>Equipment</h3>

<p>The game of Draughts is played on a standard Chess board 64 black and 
        white chequered squares.&nbsp; Each player has 12 pieces normally in the 
        form of fat round counters. &nbsp; The real shades of the pieces and the 
        board do not necessarily need to be black and white but they are normally 
        referred to as black and white, regardless.&nbsp; The board is placed 
        between the two opponents so that the near right-hand corner square is 
        white for both players (in the same way as for Chess).</p>


<h3>Preparation and Objective</h3>

<p>Black always plays first.&nbsp; A coin is tossed to decide which player 
        will be black. &nbsp; Each player's pieces are placed on the 12 black 
        squares nearest to that player. &nbsp; The white squares are not used 
        at all in the game - the pieces only move diagonally and so stay on the 
        black squares throughout.</p>

<p>The objective of the game is to take all of the opponent's pieces or 
        to produce a position such that the opponent is unable to move.</p>


<h3>Play</h3>

<p>Players take turns to move a piece of their own colour.&nbsp; Any piece 
        that reaches the far edge of the board is immediately crowned and is thereafter 
        known as a "King".&nbsp; The act of crowning is a physical one 
        - another piece of the same shade is placed on top of the piece in order 
        to distinguish it from an ordinary piece.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Until a piece is "crowned", it can only move and capture in 
        a diagonally forwards direction. &nbsp; Kings are allowed to move and 
        capture diagonally forwards and backwards and are consequently more powerful 
        and valuable than ordinary pieces.&nbsp; However, ordinary pieces can 
        capture Kings.</p>

<p>Whenever a piece has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the square 
        immediately beyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece 
        can be captured.&nbsp; If the player has the opportunity to capture one 
        or more of the opponent's pieces, then the player must do so.&nbsp; A 
        piece is taken by simply hopping over it into the vacant square beyond 
        and removing it from the board.&nbsp; Unlike an ordinary move, a capturing 
        move can consist of several such hops - if a piece takes an opponent's 
        piece and the new position allows it to take another piece, then it must 
        do so straight away.&nbsp; The move finishes only when the position of 
        the capturing piece no longer allows it to taken any more pieces or when 
        an uncrowned piece arrives at the far edge of the board and is crowned.</p>

<p>If more than one piece can capture, then the player is entirely free 
        to choose which of those pieces to move.&nbsp; Likewise, if a capturing 
        piece is able to capture in more than one direction, the player is free 
        to choose which direction to move in.&nbsp; i.e. it is not compulsory 
        to move the piece or take the route that will result in the maximum number 
        of captures.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>If no capturing moves are available, then an ordinary move is made by 
        moving a piece one square diagonally.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the past, the "huffing" rule was used.&nbsp; For this, if 
        a player noticed that the opponent had failed to capture when the option 
        was open (even if the offending piece had already captured one or more 
        pieces that turn), the player can huff the offending piece before the 
        next move is made and it is removed from the board.&nbsp; Nowadays, this 
        rule is rarely used.&nbsp; Instead a player just points out the error 
        and the opponent is forced to make the correct move.</p>


<h3>Finishing</h3>

<p>The game is won by the player who first manages to take all his opponent's 
        pieces or renders them unable to move. </p>

<p>A draw occurs by agreement at any point during the game.&nbsp; If a player 
        refuses the offer of a draw, that player is required to force a win or 
        show a decided advantage within 40 of that players own moves from that 
        point. Draws are fairly common in the game of draughts - especially at 
        the top level of the game.</p>
